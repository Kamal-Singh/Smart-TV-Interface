Note: Demonstration.mp4 shows the demo of the project just in case you are facing issues with setting up the project.

Note: The react code is also build but the development code is left for you to check the coding structure and style.

- How to set up

- MongoDB is online on mlab and React is built so no need to install them
- Just go to backend folder and install dependency using npm install.
- After that type node index.js to start the server
- For Frontend either you can run it using serve for the build or you can install the dependency.

- For the react development server.
- Go to the frontend folder type npm install for installing dependancy.
- Then type npm run wait for it the start the server.
- Then open browser and go to http://localhost:8000 to see the working project.

- For the react build one
- open terminal and type npm install -g serve let it finish.
- go to the frontend folder and simply type serve -g build and that's it.
- go to the link which the terminal shows and checkout the app.
